                <h4> Weather Forecast </h4>

                <p> The Real-Meal app was the first real-life project created with a group of aspiring web developers taking part in UWA coding bootcamp 2021. 
                </p><p>The project introduced a number
                of new frameworks and techniques, including the use of APIs and CSS Framework Bulma. Particular emphasis placed on the planning phase of s/w dev, including story boards, git branching and press release presentations! </p>

                <h4> Weather Forecast </h4>
                <p>The Weather Forecast app was the first introduction to using APIs. It taught the use of JS promises as well as dynamically managing content. The app will display a 5 day forecast to any valid City searched. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Search results are saved to local storage and retrieved on page load. In the future, the history will return refreshed weather reports! </p>

                <h4> Password Generator </h4>
               <p> The Password Generator was one of the first assignments using Javascript. It allowed the user to generate a password between 8-128 characters. It helped to develop skills with 
                   accepting user input, validating user input and returning password based on users specific criteria. 
                   </p><p> There was some difficult ensuring a consistant result when all criteria selected and only 8 character password choosen. This did result in some sleepless nights! </p>
