# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This website is my personal portfolio. It has recently been updated to showcase my past assignments and projects so far created.

# Technologies Used

Thanks to Google fonts for the selection, This site also takes advantage of Bootstrap and associated Javascript APIs. 

# Challenges

As the first iteration of my portfolio was created in the early days of developing, I found it difficult to refactor the code with the new skills obtained. There was a lot of code that didnt need to be there and with the new found knowledge, i would have done things a little differently! Future activities will be to further update the website to incorporate the new techniques learned along the way..
